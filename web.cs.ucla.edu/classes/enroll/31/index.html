<h2>CS 31 Fall 2018 Enrollment Information</h2>
<p>
Do not miss the first day of class on Friday, September 28.
</p><p>
Until Orientation ends, CS 31 is restricted to certain majors; at some
point after Orientation ends in September, the major restrictions will be
lifted.  We will not be giving out PTEs for CS 31 until the end of the
first full week of classes (but you will still have access to the course
web site).  Do <strong>not</strong> email the instructor asking for a PTE. 
Make sure you attend class September 28 and October 1, 4, and 5.
</p><p>
CS 31 has MANDATORY midterm exams on two Thursdays, October 25 and
November 15, 2018, at your choice of either 5:05 pm to 6:10 pm or 6:00 pm
to 7:05 pm.  Do not take CS 31 if you will have a midterm conflict with
another class with a midterm at the same time.
</p><p>
Save some money by reading this <a href="../textbook31.html">note about the
textbook</a>.
</p><p>
If you're an undergraduate and your major is
</p>
<ul>
<li>
CS, CS&amp;Engr, Comp Engr, EE, Ling&amp;CS, Pre CS&nbsp;B, C&amp;S Biol,
Pre Math/Com, or Math/Com:  Just sign up on MyUCLA for the class, or if
it's full, get on the wait list if there is one and it's not full.
</li><li>
an engineering major other than those listed above, or a major with a
Bioinformatics minor:  You will be able to enroll through MyUCLA after
Orientation ends in September; until then, fill out the form below so we can
assess the demand before then.
</li><li>
not in engineering and not listed above:  Fill out the form below.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you are a graduate student, fill out the form below.
</p><p>
If you are not in the School of Engineering and your major is not listed
above, be aware that
<a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/ugrad/courses/pic/10A"
target="blank">Program in Computing 10A</a> is a class that covers some of
what CS 31 does, although if you ask around, the word is that it is less
intense than CS 31.  If all you're looking for is an introduction to
programming, PIC 10A is for you.
</p><p>
If you want to enroll in CS 31 for Fall 2018, but are unable to get into
the class or onto the wait list, if any, submit this form to record your
interest in taking the class.  Check MyUCLA or the
<a href="https://sa.ucla.edu/ro/public/soc" target="_blank">Schedule of
Classes</a> first, so that you don't pick discussion times that will
conflict with your other classes.
</p><p>
Our accepting this form is <em>not</em> a promise you'll get in; it's
merely a way for us to capture your contact information for any
announcements and to measure demand to add discussion sections at
appropriate times in preparation for issuing PTEs at the end of the first full
week of classes.  <em>We</em> will contact <em>you</em> when there is relevant
news to report.  Essentially, we're asking you to please leave us alone &mdash;
if it were just you (singular), we wouldn't have to say that, but you
(singular) wouldn't believe how many of you (plural) there are, flooding our
mailboxes with similar messages.  Historically, everyone who has wanted to
get into CS 31 in Fall and has come to class every day the first week has
gotten in.

<h2>Should I take CS 30 or CS 31 in Fall?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom:0">
You should enroll in CS 31 if you have written the following in any
programming language:
</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
<li>
a program using an array (or ArrayList or vector or list or any other
sequence container) and, as the same or a different program,
</li><li>
a program in which you called a function (or method) that you wrote that
accepts one or more parameters (or arguments).
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-top:0">
Otherwise, you should enroll in
<a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~todd/cs30.html">CS 30, <em>Principles and
Practices of Computing</em></a>, a new course designed to give students
without prior programming experience the necessary background to succeed
in CS 31 and beyond.
beyond.
</p><p>
Starting last year, <strong>Fall CS 31 assumes you have the prior experience
indicated above</strong>.  If you do not have this prior experience, you
are likely to find Fall CS 31 rough going.  Since we have taught thousands
of students and you haven't, you should trust our judgment.
</p><p>
Unlike in Fall, CS 31 in Winter, Spring, and Summer assumes no prior
programming experience.
