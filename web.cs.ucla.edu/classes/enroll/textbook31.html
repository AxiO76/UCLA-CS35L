<h2>Computer Science 31 Textbook</h2>
</p>
<p>
The textbook for CS 31 is Walter Savitch's <em>Absolute C++</em>.  It's
available in a variety of editions and formats.  You will be best served
with the sixth edition, but the fifth or the fourth editions are OK. 
Whether you get the bound softcover or the loose-leaf or the etext format,
with or without MyProgrammingLab or other publisher add-ons, the US or
international edition, a new or used book, etc., is a matter between you
and your wallet.
