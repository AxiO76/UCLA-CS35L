<h2>Grad Student Enrollment in Undergraduate Computer Science Classes</h2>
<p>
If you are a graduate student who wants to enroll in an undergraduate class,
you <strong>must</strong> express your interest using this form.  (You should
be somewhere else if you're an <a href="ug.html">undergrad</a> or if you're
a <a href="gg.html">grad student wanting a graduate class</a>.)
</p><p>
Most undergraduate students have priority over graduate students in
enrolling in undergraduate CS class.  During the normal enrollment
period, you will <strong>not</strong> be able to enroll in an
undergraduate class through MyUCLA.  We've set up this form so that you can
tell us what your preferences are now, before the quarter starts, so we
can make plans to try to accommodate you.  The sooner you fill out this
form (even if it's well before MyUCLA enrollment starts), the better the
planning we can do to accommodate as many grad students as we can.
</p><p>
Our accepting this form is <strong>not</strong> a promise you'll get in; it's
merely a way for us to measure demand.  We are collecting your email address,
so <em>we</em> will contact <em>you</em> when there's relevant news to report.
Essentially, we're asking you to please leave us alone &mdash; if it were just
you (singular), we wouldn't have to say that, but you (singular) wouldn't
believe how many of you (plural) there are, flooding instructors' mailboxes
with similar messages.  It might not be until the end of the first full week
of the quarter that we issue actual PTEs.
</p><p>
The instructor of a course may or may not circulate a signup list the first
day of class to assess any remaining demand for the class.  A grad student who
has not both filled out this form in a timely manner and shown up in class
the first day is usually unlikely to get in.
</p><p>
<!--
Grad students tend to be pretty responsible when it comes to filling out a
form like this in order to use the process we set up to help get people
the classes they want.  Still, there are some grad students who ignore the
notice our Grad Office sent them telling about this form, and then show up
the first day trying to get into some full class.  Such a student is often
told that if they had filled out the form in a timely manner, they'd
already be in the class, but now it's too late to be able to accomodate
them.   Often, instead of thinking "Well, that was foolish of me!  Next
time I'll use the process that's designed to help me.", they gripe to
their friends about how UCLA makes it impossible to get into classes, not
realizing that their friends who are nodding sympathetically are really
thinking "What a doofus!", which is shorthand for "Good luck getting
through life if instead of learning from your mistakes, you're always
shifting the blame for them to others."
</p><p>
-->
(Note:  If the online enrollment system says something about not having
taken the requisite courses at UCLA, don't worry about that aspect of
things.  We are enforcing requisites for undergrads to manage their flow
though their curriculum, and the online system has no mechanism for
turning that off for grad students, for whom we have no such
requisite-enforcement policy.)

new preferences; a later submission replaces an earlier one.

(If you had previously signed up to express interest in taking one or more
undergrad classes but are now enrolled in every undergrad class you want,
so have no need for us to retain any previous request you made, we'd
appreciate it if you'd let us know to erase your request by filling
nothing out below this, checking this box and submitting this form.
