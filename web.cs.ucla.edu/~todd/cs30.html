<center><h2>CS30: Principles and Practices of Computing</h2></center>
  

<p>We have introduced a new course, <i>CS30: Principles and Practices of
Computing</i>, for incoming students who have little or no prior
programming experience, as a precursor to CS31. The goal of CS30 is
to give those students the necessary background to succeed in CS31
and beyond.

<p>CS30 uses the popular Python programming language as a vehicle
for introducing students to programming and the broader field of
computing.  Students will learn how to design, implement, and test
programs that solve computational problems.  Key concepts learned
will include:

<ul>
<li>functional decomposition: the ability to break a task into an
appropriate set of subtasks, each implemented as a function</li>
<li>usage of common data types: integers, booleans, strings, and lists
and similar container data structures</li>
<li>usage of common control structures: conditionals and loops</li>
</ul>

Due to the introduction of CS30, <b>Fall CS31 assumes that students have
prior experience with the above concepts in some programming
language</b>.  You should enroll in Fall CS31 only if you have written the
following in any programming language:

<ul>
<li>a program using an array (or ArrayList or vector or list or any other
sequence container) and, as the same or a different program,</li>
<li>a program in which you called a function (or method) that you wrote
that accepts one or more parameters (or arguments).</li>
</ul>

Otherwise, you should enroll in CS30 in Fall and plan to take CS31 in
Winter.  This will not put you behind in your degree schedule and
will give you the strongest preparation for the rest of the CS
introductory sequence.

<p>Unlike the Fall offering, in Winter, Spring, and Summer, CS31
  assumes no prior programming experience.
